Read a interview question to write an algorithm to convert entered numeric values to words (ex: 1--one ,2 - two) for up to six digits. Is it hard to convert ? No . We could do this in lot many ways but an effective program which uses proper data structure and algorithm that's what it takes.

Here I got it <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ourorganisationsite/number-to-currency">https://sites.google.com/site/ourorganisationsite/number-to-currency</a>

I had a dictionary to hold one and Tenths position words then rest lies in identifying the position of a numeric.<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5IIBwKsUEus/TsWh1GnVp8I/AAAAAAAAFP4/671q2JVJi5w/s1600/Untitled.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5IIBwKsUEus/TsWh1GnVp8I/AAAAAAAAFP4/671q2JVJi5w/s400/Untitled.png" width="400" /></a>
